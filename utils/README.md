This directory has some Python scripts made for facilitating the development of Heartbound Save Editor. They are not required for running the program, but they might also help you if you want to develop the editor.

There are scripts for cleaning up and organizing the save structure file, mapping the rooms in-game, ang importing the missing DLL's for the project. The scripts run on [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Please check the source of each script for its explanation.
