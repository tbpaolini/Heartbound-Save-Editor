The images on this folder were ripped from the Heartbound game. They are used by Heartbound Save Editor for illustrating the game's locations.

The author of the Save Editor believes that that the use of said images fall into Fair Use, because:
* It is a small subset of the game's images.
* They are being used for illustative purposes.
* Heartbound Save Editor is a non-commercial software.
* The Editor itself is not of any use without the game itself, so it does not replace playing the game.

The Heartbound's graphics were made by [River](https://twitter.com/rivermakes).
