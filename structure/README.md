The save file structure has been ontained from [https://nav.steets.tech/hbsavestruc](https://nav.steets.tech/hbsavestruc). The structure has been built with valuable information provided by Jason Thor Hall (lead developer of Heartbound); and put together by Steets, Terra Hatvol, and me (Tiago Becerra Paolini).

The `.xlsx` file is the unmodified file downloaded from the aforementioned link. This file has been converted to Tabulation Separated Values (`.tsv`) by me, with minor manual edits to make the text more understandable and fix typos. Then I made a Python script to add spaces before uppercase characters in the middle of words (CamelCase), in order to make the text more user friendly.

The .tsv file will be parsed by the editor in order to build the user interface.
