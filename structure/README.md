The save file structure has been ontained from [https://nav.steets.tech/hbsavestruc](https://nav.steets.tech/hbsavestruc). The structure has been built with valuable information provided by Jason Thor Hall (lead developer of Heartbound); and put together by Steets, Terra Hatvol, and me (Tiago Becerra Paolini).

The Excel (`.xlsx`) [file](https://github.com/tbpaolini/Heartbound-Save-Editor/blob/master/structure/Save%20File%20Structure.xlsx) is the unmodified file downloaded from the aforementioned link. This file has been converted to Tabulation Separated Values (`.tsv`). Then I made a [Python script](https://github.com/tbpaolini/Heartbound-Save-Editor/blob/master/utils/struct_file_cleanup.py) that makes some changes to the file, in order to make the text more user friendly. Most notably adding spaces before uppercase characters in the middle of words (CamelCase), in order to make the text more user friendly. This new `.tsv` [file](https://github.com/tbpaolini/Heartbound-Save-Editor/blob/master/structure/save_structure.tsv) is parsed by the editor in order to build the user interface.

Then the [places list file](https://github.com/tbpaolini/Heartbound-Save-Editor/blob/master/structure/places_list.tsv) was built from the save structure file with the help of [another Python script](https://github.com/tbpaolini/Heartbound-Save-Editor/blob/master/utils/places_listing.py), in order to get a list all unique locations in game. Then the file was manually edited in order to place the entries in the order they should appear on the interface.

Finally, there is a file to list the [coordinates of the room's entry points](https://github.com/tbpaolini/Heartbound-Save-Editor/blob/master/structure/room_coordinates.tsv). That file was built with the help of a [Python script for mapping the rooms](https://github.com/tbpaolini/Heartbound-Save-Editor/blob/master/utils/room_mapping.py), which stores the coordinates by pressing `Space` while playing, and [a script](https://github.com/tbpaolini/Heartbound-Save-Editor/blob/master/utils/unmapped_rooms.py) to check which rooms still needed to be mapped. Then the tooms were sorted in alphabetical order with the aid of [another Python script](https://github.com/tbpaolini/Heartbound-Save-Editor/blob/master/utils/room_sorting.py).
